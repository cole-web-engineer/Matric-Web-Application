                                    9.1. This contract will terminate when your child completes the College’s curriculum and any exit examination we offer at the end of your child's schooling, unless otherwise terminated on the terms of this contract. This contract therefore has an indefinite term.

                                    9.2. You have the right to cancel this contract at any time, for any reason, provided that you give the College a full term’s notice, in writing, of this intention before the withdrawal of the child from the College. Alternatively, a full term’s fees is payable to the College in lieu of notice. Such amount is due and payable on the first day of the term which would have been the final term if the appropriate notice had been given. In the event that any fees have been paid in advance, those fees will be credited in proportion to the terms remaining, less any amount payable in lieu of appropriate notice.

The College's alternative remedies remain reserved, the college may cancel this contract immediately and has no obligation to return any deposit or pre-paid fees in the event of material breach and have not (in the case of a breach which is capable of remedy) remedied the material breach within twenty (20) business days of a notice from the College requiring you to do so. The college may claim payment of all moneys then owing and damages equal to one term’s fees.
